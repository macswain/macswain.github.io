    	<h2>My Background</h2>
    	<p>Hi there! My name is Mackenzie Erin Swain and currently I am a Junior at Indiana University 		         Bloomington. I am studying Informatics at the School of Informatics and Computing as well as 				         receiving a minor in Marketing at the Kelley School of Business. My professional background varies         between technical and creative. During the summer of 2016, I created my first website, linked below,         for a small company called Denise Lovat Health Coach. Additionally the following fall semester, I         worked as an Undergraduate Instructor for an introductory Informatics course at Indiana University         where I taught technical languages such as HTML/CSS, Python, MySQL, and JavaScript to students         ranging from freshmen to seniors in college. From this experience I have learned that I enjoy working         with other people and that I get along well with many different types of people. Lastly, I have         experience working with my sorority as a part of the Personal Relations committee where I controlled         the Social Media accounts as well as maintained the chapter's website with two other members. From         this position, I furthered my technical skills in working with a website, in addition to         strengthening my marketing skills by working with social media to promote our sorority. With the         tecnical advancements today, it is vital to keep up with the changing environment. Therefore working         with marketing on a technical platform for my sorority is much like how companies run their marketing         campaigns today. This past October, I was sponsored by Indiana University to attend the Grace Hopper         Conference in Houston, Texas where women working in technology all across the nation came together         for one conference. At this conference, I was inspired by the multide of speakers, tutorials, and         seminars that occurred throughout the three day conference. After leaving the conference, I have         gained a new attitude, perspective, and drive to give my all and make a change while doing something         I love.</p>
